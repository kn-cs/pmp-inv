This work focuses on efficient inversion in cryptographically relevant Mersenne and pseudo-Mersenne prime order fields, targeting the various Intel architectures. A total of twenty primes has been worked with at various security level, out of which thirteen primes are well known in the area of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).
