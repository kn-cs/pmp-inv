# Efficient Inversion in (Pseudo-)Mersenne Prime Order Fields

This is the source code repository of the work: "Efficient Inversion in (Pseudo-)Mersenne Prime Order Fields", authored by Kaushik Nath & Palash Sarkar of Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India.

This work focuses on efficient inversion in cryptographically relevant Mersenne and pseudo-Mersenne prime order fields, targeting the various Intel architectures. A total of twenty primes has been worked with at various security level, out of which thirteen primes are well known in the area of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).

Source codes of the work would be uploaded after the paper appears online in Cryptology ePrint Archive.
