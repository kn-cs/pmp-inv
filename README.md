## Efficient FLT-based inversion in Mersenne and pseudo-Mersenne prime order fields targeting the Intel architectures

This is the source code repository of the work [Efficient Inversion in (Pseudo-)Mersenne Prime Order Fields](https://eprint.iacr.org/eprint-bin/getfile.pl?entry=2018/985&version=20181106:063428&file=985.pdf), authored by [Kaushik Nath](kaushikn_r@isical.ac.in) & [Palash Sarkar](palash@isical.ac.in) of [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India](https://www.isical.ac.in).
This work focuses on efficient FLT-based inversion in cryptographically relevant Mersenne and pseudo-Mersenne prime order fields targeting the various Intel architectures. A total of 20 primes has been considered in the work which covers various security levels.

To report a bug or make a comment regarding the implementations please drop a mail to: [Kaushik Nath](kaushikn_r@isical.ac.in).

### Compilation and execution of programs 
    
* Please compile the ```makefile``` in the **test** directory and execute the generated executable file. 
* One can change the architecture accordingly in the makefile before compilation. Default provided is ```Skylake```.
